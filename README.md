  React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

To set up your environment for React with Vite, follow the steps provided in the "Frontend (React + Vite)" section above.
